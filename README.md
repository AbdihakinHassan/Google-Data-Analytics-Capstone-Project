# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study
## by Hassan Abdihakin

This is a case study analysis of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, with the aim of providing data insights and professional data visualizations to support recommendations for a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. The analysis focuses on how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and the factors contributing to these differences.

# DataSet
The data used for this analysis is provided by Cyclistic and contains bike-share data for the year 2021. The data was cleaned and processed using Python and Pandas library to ensure data accuracy and consistency here is the link to data https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html .

# Analysis
The analysis includes the following:

Average hire time of users
Seasonal analysis
Monthly analysis
Day of week analysis
Time of day analysis
The analysis identifies that casual riders tend to use bikes for longer ride durations, covering more distance during weekends specifically from mid-morning until evening. On the other hand, annual members are more likely to use bikes during weekday morning hours. This difference in usage patterns raises questions such as what factors are contributing to these differences, and how Cyclistic can leverage these insights to convert casual riders into annual members.

# Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

Convert casuals to annual members with targeted incentives and cost-saving communication during the Spring season.
Develop marketing campaigns specifically targeting casual riders during the month of May to encourage them to rent bikes more frequently and increase the number of annual memberships over time.
# Tools
The analysis was performed using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The code and data used for the analysis are available in this GitHub repository.

# Future Work
This case study provides valuable insights into the differences between casual riders and annual members, and how Cyclistic can convert casual riders into annual members. Future work could involve further analysis to identify other factors that could be contributing to these differences and developing more targeted marketing strategies to encourage conversions.
